        <h2>Instructions for using the Annotation Tool</h2>
        <p>
        1. At the beginning you need to select the project id you want to work on. Application will download images and annotations from the server, if not already downloaded. Then the project will be opened in the appropriate mode (annotation/review/correction) depending on task status on the portal.
